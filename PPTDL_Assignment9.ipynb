    "The main idea behind transfer learning is that features learned by a model on a source task can be useful for a target task. Instead of training a new model from scratch on the target task, we initialize the model with the pre-trained weights and fine-tune it on the target task with a smaller dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of transfer learning include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved training efficiency: Transfer learning reduces the time and computational resources required for training, as the model starts with pre-learned features that are applicable to the target task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better generalization: Pre-training on a large dataset helps the model learn generic features that can generalize well to new data, even with limited target task data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling data scarcity: Transfer learning is particularly valuable when the target task has limited labeled data. By leveraging knowledge from a source task, the model can benefit from the larger labeled dataset of the source task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effective feature extraction: Pre-trained models often learn meaningful and high-level representations of data. Transfer learning allows us to use these features as a starting point for the target task, potentially capturing important patterns and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Domain adaptation: Transfer learning enables the adaptation of models to new domains or datasets with different characteristics, improving performance on the target task in a new environment."
